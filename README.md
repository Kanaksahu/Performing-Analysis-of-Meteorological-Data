# Performing-Analysis-of-Meteorological-Data
This Blog is created so as to determine the correctness of the null hypothesis (H0) about the meteorological data.
It is a part of the first project — Performing Analysis of Meteorological Data for my Data Analytics using Python internship program at Suven Consultants & Technology Pvt. Ltd.
# GOAL
The main objective of this Internship (of data analysis) is to transform the raw data into information and then convert it into knowledge:
* Perform data cleaning,
* Perform analysis for testing the given Null Hypothesis (H0) &
* Write a descriptive blog with relevant visualizations to prove your point.
# Null Hypothesis (H0)
The Null Hypothesis H0 is “Has the Apparent temperature and humidity compared monthly across 10 years of the data indicate an increase due to Global warming”
The H0 means we need to find whether the for the month of a month say April starting from 2006 to 2016 and the for the same period have increased or not. This monthly analysis has to be done for all 12 months over the 10 year period. So basically resampling your data from hourly to monthly, then comparing the same month over the 10 year period. Support the analysis by appropriate visualizations using matplotlib and / or seaborn library.
